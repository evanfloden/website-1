Often this workflow includes the generation of key figures from the article based on data.</p> <p>A typical measure for documentation is to provide at least so much information as the author would themselves need after a long period of time, e.g. 1 year, to run the analysis again. Any researcher, even if not familiar with the software stack, should be able to run the workflow and find out if the code works.</p> <p>Common sense shall be applied to decide about the suitable amount of data and to handle big datasets and privacy concerns. For example, data may be deposited depending on community practices in remote repositories, synthetic data may be used, subsets or preprocessed data may be included, or protected access to information may be provided (e.g. cloud-based data enclaves).</p> <p>The minimal set of files, besides data and code, to implement a CODE CHECK process are the following:</p> <ol> <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">README</code> file</strong> with instructions how to execute the workflow</li> <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">MANIFEST</code> file</strong> with a list of output files created by the workflow - these must be created by the workflow and are the basis for validating a successful check</li> <li><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">LICENSE</code> file</strong> with information about licenses for all submitted material, e.g. code license for scripts and data licenses for used datasets</li> </ol> <p>These files and the worklow are published in a dedicated self-contained <em>GitHub</em> repository.</p> <p>Beyond that, any additional configuration and information is extremely helpful, of course. Concrete guidelines as to what this can entail are given by the codechecker’s tasks below and the concept of a <a href="https://research-compendium.science/">research compendium</a>.</p> <h2 id="codechecker-tasks">Codechecker tasks</h2> <p>Prerequisite: familiarity with <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code>, https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/make/make.html</p> <ul> <li>Create a directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">codecheck</code> to not interfere with original files (may use <code class="highlighter-rouge">.codecheck</code> if <code class="highlighter-rouge">codecheck</code> exists in submission)</li> <li>Re-run the workflow based on provided documentation, i.e. recreate all files listed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">MANIFEST</code>, based on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> <ul> <li>template found at XXXX</li> <li>Create a notebook?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Document the used computing environment using suitable configuration files, see <a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#config-files"><em>REES</em> specification</a>, for example by creating one or several of the following files or tools: <ul> <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code></li> <li>Binder</li> <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">environment.yml</code></li> <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code></li> <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">DESCRIPTION</code> file (R package)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Add a <em>report</em> <ul> <li>WHO checked WHAT, and HOW?</li> <li>Are used pieces of software and data properly CITED and publicly DEPOSITED und suitable LICENSES?</li> <li>Are open formats (text-based) included?</li> <li>Is data and <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026">software</a> FAIR?</li> <li>template found at XXXX</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deposit the original material along with the reproduced files on <em>Zenodo</em> under you name, adding the original authors as co-authors</li> </ul> <p>Every code check is unique, just as the associated research article. The codechecker can thereby rely on the following examples and future published code checks for good practices and approaches.</p> <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2> <h3 id="hopfield-1982"><a href="https://github.com/codecheckers/Hopfield-1982">Hopfield, 1982</a></h3> <p>A landmark paper from neuroscience, reproduced by <a href="https://github.com/sebwyh">@sebwyh</a> with edits by <a href="https://github.com/nuest">@nuest</a>.</p> <p>Codechecker: <a href="https://github.com/nuest">@nuest</a></p> <p>Comments:</p> <ul> <li>seed not set, but human can judge the code works</li> <li>codechecker added <code class="highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code> using <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip freeze</code> after workflow could be executed</li> <li>codechecker added text to README about the computing environment</li> </ul> <h3 id="hancock-1991">Hancock, 1991</h3> <p>TBD</p> <p>###</p> <p>TBD</p> <p>###</p> <p>TBD</p> <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2> <h3 id="why-make-">Why <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> ?</h3> <!-- make on Windows? --> <ul> <li>it’s old, works, and is available</li> <li>caching</li> </ul> <h3 id="how-should-i-best-package-my-code-and-data">How should I best package my code and data?</h3> <p>So that the codechecker can make sense of it.

This is a <em>huge</em> step forward, and we are excited for the times when even more will be commonplace. The check largely increases the chances that the checked code works for third parties and is accessible, e.g. using text-based file formats, and portable, e.g. using containers. The <em>files</em> and <em>archives</em> (a Docker image is a tarball of a directory system) will be readable much longer than tools will be there to easily work with them.</p> </div> </article>
